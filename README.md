# Shopping cart

# Components structure

## Planning

1. Set up components

- Sketch out components i need - think about the static version first
- Set up React router Links to each page(store, home, cart pages)
- [ ] Will I need a navbar component? -> will add one later if i need one
- 

2. Add routing

- Header(logo and navbar) should be in StorePage and HomePage 
- [ ] Decide whether CartPage is going to have Header or not later
- Currently, both App comp and Header comp shares "/" path
