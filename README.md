# Shopping cart

# Components structure

## Planning

1. Set up components

- Sketch out components i need - think about the static version first
- Set up React router Links to each page(store, home, cart pages)
- Will I need a navbar component? -> will add one later if i need one
- 

2. Add interactivity
